School shootings within the United States do not
occur randomly but show geographic and temporal clustering,
as well as an increased probability 
as a function of social media volume
about attacks.
Lone wolf attacks at US colleges have been accelerating
in frequency in the last 25 years, and attacks
after relative lulls in violence tend to be more deadly.
